<p>
  This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During my studies, I developed an interest in fullstack development and decided to focus initially on the frontend. Based on what I've learned so far, I created this project to demonstrate my knowledge. I recognize that there's still much to improve, but I'm very proud to have completed this step and excited to keep enhancing my skills.
  In this project, I worked primarily with HTML and CSS, and it includes:
    - 4 pages
    - Responsiveness
    - Form
    - Image slider
    - Custom design

  I hope you like it!
